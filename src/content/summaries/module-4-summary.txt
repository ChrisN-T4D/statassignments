MODULE 4: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS - SUMMARY
===========================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Calculating descriptive statistics is one of the very first things you do when analyzing real data.
Descriptive statistics are simpler to understand than inferential statistics, but choosing good
descriptives is crucial for understanding and communicating about data.

MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY (Section 4.1)
-------------------------------------------
Central tendency measures tell you WHERE the data are located - the "typical" or "middle" value.

Key Measures:
• MEAN (X̄): The arithmetic average
  - Formula: X̄ = (1/N)Σ(Xi)
  - Interpretation: "Center of gravity" of the data
  - Sensitive to outliers and extreme values
  - Best for: Interval/ratio scale data with symmetric distributions

• MEDIAN: The middle value when data are sorted
  - 50th percentile of the distribution
  - Robust to outliers
  - Best for: Ordinal data or skewed distributions

• MODE: The most frequently occurring value
  - Can have multiple modes (bimodal, multimodal)
  - Only measure suitable for nominal data
  - Best for: Categorical/nominal data

When to Use Each:
- Nominal data → Mode
- Ordinal data → Median (preferred) or Mode
- Interval/Ratio data → Mean (if symmetric) or Median (if skewed)

Important Example: Housing Price Data
The Commonwealth Bank used MEAN incomes with MEDIAN house prices, which artificially
lowered the price-to-income ratio. The correct approach (Demographia) used median incomes
with median prices. This shows why choosing appropriate descriptives matters!

MEASURES OF VARIABILITY (Section 4.2)
--------------------------------------
Variability measures tell you how "SPREAD OUT" the data are.

Key Measures:
• RANGE: Maximum - Minimum
  - Simple but very sensitive to outliers
  - Rarely used except when extremes matter

• INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR): 75th percentile - 25th percentile
  - Range of the "middle 50%" of data
  - Robust to outliers
  - Complements the median nicely
  - Commonly used in practice

• MEAN ABSOLUTE DEVIATION (AAD): Average distance from the mean
  - Formula: AAD(X) = (1/N)Σ|Xi - X̄|
  - Interpretable but has mathematical limitations
  - Rarely used in psychology

• VARIANCE (σ²): Average squared deviation from the mean
  - Formula: Var(X) = (1/N)Σ(Xi - X̄)²
  - Sample version: s² = [1/(N-1)]Σ(Xi - X̄)²
  - Mathematically elegant, additive property
  - Problem: Expressed in squared units (uninterpretable!)
  - Almost never reported directly

• STANDARD DEVIATION (σ or s): Square root of variance
  - Formula: σ̂ = √{[1/(N-1)]Σ(Xi - X̄)²}
  - Expressed in original units (interpretable!)
  - Most popular measure of variability
  - Default when mean is used for central tendency

The "68-95-99.7 Rule":
For approximately normal distributions:
- 68% of data fall within 1 SD of the mean
- 95% of data fall within 2 SD of the mean
- 99.7% of data fall within 3 SD of the mean

Why N-1 Instead of N?
jamovi (and most software) divides by N-1 when calculating variance and SD. This is because
we're usually estimating population parameters from a sample, not just describing the sample
itself. The N-1 adjustment provides an unbiased estimate. This distinction becomes important
in Chapter 8 (Estimation).

Most Commonly Used:
• IQR and Standard Deviation are by far the two most popular measures
• IQR pairs well with the median
• Standard deviation pairs well with the mean

SKEWNESS AND KURTOSIS (Section 4.3)
------------------------------------
These describe the SHAPE of the distribution.

SKEWNESS: Measure of asymmetry
• Negative skew (left skew): Long tail to the left, mode > median > mean
• Zero skew: Symmetric distribution, mean ≈ median ≈ mode
• Positive skew (right skew): Long tail to the right, mean > median > mode

Formula: skewness(X) = [1/(Nσ̂³)]Σ(Xi - X̄)³

Interpretation Rule of Thumb:
• If |skewness/SE| > 2, data are significantly skewed (especially in samples N < 50)
• May affect suitability for certain statistical tests

KURTOSIS: Measure of "pointiness"
• Negative (Platykurtic): "Too flat" - fewer extreme values than normal
• Zero (Mesokurtic): "Just right" - like a normal distribution
• Positive (Leptokurtic): "Too pointy" - more extreme values than normal

Formula: kurtosis(X) = [1/(Nσ̂⁴)]Σ(Xi - X̄)⁴ - 3

Note: The "-3" adjustment makes the normal distribution have kurtosis = 0

In Practice:
• Skewness is reported fairly often
• Kurtosis is rarely reported in psychology research

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS BY GROUP (Section 4.4)
----------------------------------------------
Often need to compare descriptive statistics across groups.

In jamovi:
• Use the "Split by" function in Descriptives
• Can split by one or more grouping variables
• Useful for comparing groups before formal hypothesis testing

Example: Clinical trial data comparing therapy types
• No therapy, CBT, drug treatment
• Compare mean mood gain across groups
• Check variability within each group

Warning: Splitting by too many variables can result in very small subgroup sizes,
leading to unstable estimates (jamovi may show NaN or Inf).

STANDARD SCORES (Z-SCORES) (Section 4.5)
-----------------------------------------
Z-scores standardize raw scores relative to their distribution.

Formula: z = (X - X̄)/σ̂

Interpretation:
• z-score = number of standard deviations above (+) or below (-) the mean
• z = 0 means the score equals the mean
• z = 1 means one SD above the mean
• z = -2 means two SD below the mean

Why Use Z-Scores?
1. Interpret position within a distribution
   - z = 3.6 means you're in the top ~0.02% (very extreme!)
   - z = -0.5 means you're slightly below average

2. Compare scores across different scales
   - Can't compare raw score of 35 on grumpiness (max 50) with raw score of 2 on
     extraversion (max 24)
   - But CAN compare z-grumpiness = 3.6 with z-extraversion = -2.75
   - Shows you're more extremely grumpy than you are non-extraverted

Important:
• Z-scores are a bridge between descriptive and inferential statistics
• They appear throughout statistics (hypothesis testing, regression, etc.)
• Make sure you understand this concept - it comes back repeatedly!

KEY TAKEAWAYS
-------------
1. Always start data analysis with descriptive statistics
2. Choose measures appropriate for your data type and distribution
3. Report both central tendency AND variability
4. Most common combinations:
   - Mean + Standard Deviation (for symmetric data)
   - Median + IQR (for skewed data or ordinal scales)
5. Understand what each statistic tells you AND what it doesn't tell you
6. Z-scores let you standardize and compare across different measures

CRITICAL INSIGHT: Good Descriptive Statistics Are DESCRIPTIVE!
---------------------------------------------------------------
"The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic."
- Josef Stalin

This quote reminds us that:
• Statistics are abstractions - they summarize individual events
• Numbers alone don't tell the full story
• Our job is to turn statistics into meaningful DESCRIPTIONS
• Always think about context, framing, and the human audience
• The goal is COMMUNICATION, not just calculation

As a data analyst, you must:
✓ Choose statistics that accurately represent the data
✓ Put numbers into context that audiences can understand
✓ Remember the individual cases behind the aggregated numbers
✓ Think critically about what statistics reveal AND what they hide

Statistics can clarify the scale of events beyond our experience, but only when
combined with thoughtful interpretation and presentation.

FORMULA REFERENCE
-----------------
Mean: X̄ = (1/N)Σ(Xi)
Variance: s² = [1/(N-1)]Σ(Xi - X̄)²
Standard Deviation: s = √{[1/(N-1)]Σ(Xi - X̄)²}
Z-score: z = (X - X̄)/σ̂
Skewness: skewness(X) = [1/(Nσ̂³)]Σ(Xi - X̄)³
Kurtosis: kurtosis(X) = [1/(Nσ̂⁴)]Σ(Xi - X̄)⁴ - 3

Where:
N = number of observations
Xi = individual observation
X̄ = sample mean
σ̂ = sample standard deviation
Σ = summation (add up all values)

In Chapter 5, we'll learn how to visualize data through graphs and plots -
because sometimes a picture really is worth a thousand words (or statistics)!
