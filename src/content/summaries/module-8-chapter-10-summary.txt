MODULE 8: CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS (CHAPTER 10)
==================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This module covers statistical tests for categorical (nominal scale) data. The chapter introduces chi-square tests and related procedures commonly used when analyzing frequency data and contingency tables.

KEY CONCEPTS
------------

1. THE χ² GOODNESS-OF-FIT TEST (10.1)
   - One of the oldest hypothesis tests (Pearson 1900)
   - Tests whether observed frequency distribution matches expected distribution
   - Compares observed frequencies to expected frequencies

   Test Statistic:
   - χ² = Σ[(Oi - Ei)²/Ei]
   - Oi = observed frequency for category i
   - Ei = expected frequency for category i
   - Expected frequency: Ei = N × Pi (where Pi is expected probability)

   Sampling Distribution:
   - Follows χ² distribution with k-1 degrees of freedom
   - k = number of categories
   - Large χ² values indicate poor fit to null hypothesis

   In jamovi:
   - Frequencies → One Sample Proportion Tests → N Outcomes
   - Can specify custom expected proportions
   - Shows observed vs. expected frequencies

2. THE χ² TEST OF INDEPENDENCE (10.2)
   - Used for contingency tables (cross-tabulation of two variables)
   - Tests whether two categorical variables are independent
   - H₀: Variables are independent (no association)
   - H₁: Variables are associated

   Test Statistic:
   - χ² = ΣΣ[(Eij - Oij)²/Eij]
   - Sum over all rows (i) and columns (j)
   - Expected frequency: Eij = (Ri × Cj)/N

   Degrees of Freedom:
   - df = (r-1)(c-1)
   - r = number of rows
   - c = number of columns

   In jamovi:
   - Frequencies → Contingency Tables → Independent Samples
   - Shows contingency table and χ² test results
   - Can display expected counts

3. THE CONTINUITY CORRECTION (10.3)
   - Yates correction for 2×2 tables (df = 1)
   - Corrects for approximation error with small samples
   - Modified statistic: χ² = Σ[(|Ei - Oi| - 0.5)²/Ei]
   - Subtracts 0.5 from absolute differences
   - Makes test more conservative
   - Available as checkbox option in jamovi

4. EFFECT SIZE (10.4)

   a) Phi (φ) Statistic:
      - φ = √(χ²/N)
      - Ranges 0-1 for 2×2 tables
      - Can exceed 1 for larger tables (problematic)

   b) Cramér's V (Preferred):
      - V = √[χ²/(N(k-1))]
      - k = min(r, c) (smaller of rows or columns)
      - Always ranges from 0 (no association) to 1 (perfect association)
      - Works for any table size
      - Available in jamovi Statistics options

5. ASSUMPTIONS OF THE TESTS (10.5)

   a) Expected Frequencies Sufficiently Large:
      - General rule: All expected frequencies > 5
      - For larger tables: 80% of cells > 5, none < 1
      - These are guidelines, not hard rules
      - Small expected frequencies → use Fisher exact test

   b) Independence of Observations:
      - Each observation counted only once
      - No observation influences another
      - Violation → inflated or deflated significance
      - If violated → consider McNemar test (for paired data)

6. THE FISHER EXACT TEST (10.6)
   - Used when expected frequencies too small for χ² test
   - Calculates exact p-value (no approximation)
   - Treats row and column totals as fixed
   - Based on hypergeometric distribution
   - Computes probability of observed table (or more extreme)
   - Most common for 2×2 tables
   - In jamovi: checkbox in Statistics options
   - No test statistic reported, only p-value

7. THE MCNEMAR TEST (10.7)
   - For repeated measures with categorical data
   - Tests marginal homogeneity (paired data)
   - Same participants measured twice
   - H₀: Pb = Pc (off-diagonal frequencies equal)

   Test Statistic (with Yates correction):
   - χ² = (|b - c| - 0.5)²/(b + c)
   - b = number who changed from category 1 to 2
   - c = number who changed from category 2 to 1
   - df = 1

   In jamovi:
   - Frequencies → Contingency Tables → Paired Samples
   - Each participant appears once in table
   - Tests if proportions changed between measurements

8. INDEPENDENCE VS. MCNEMAR (10.8)

   Use Independence Test when:
   - Testing if two variables are related
   - Different participants in different cells
   - Interested in relationship between variables

   Use McNemar Test when:
   - Testing if proportions changed over time
   - Same participants measured twice
   - Interested in whether row totals differ from column totals
   - Repeated measures design

KEY FORMULAS
------------
- Goodness-of-fit: χ² = Σ[(Oi - Ei)²/Ei], df = k-1
- Independence: χ² = ΣΣ[(Eij - Oij)²/Eij], df = (r-1)(c-1)
- Expected frequency (GOF): Ei = N × Pi
- Expected frequency (Independence): Eij = (Ri × Cj)/N
- Phi: φ = √(χ²/N)
- Cramér's V: V = √[χ²/(N(k-1))]
- McNemar: χ² = (|b - c| - 0.5)²/(b + c), df = 1

JAMOVI PROCEDURES
-----------------

1. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test:

   - No minimum sample size requirement

DECISION TREE FOR CHOOSING TESTS
---------------------------------

Start: What type of categorical data?
│
├─ One categorical variable
│  └─ Compare to expected distribution → χ² Goodness-of-Fit Test
│     ├─ Expected frequencies large? → Standard test
│     └─ Expected frequencies small? → Proceed with caution
│
├─ Two categorical variables, independent groups
│  └─ Test for association → χ² Test of Independence
│     ├─ Expected frequencies large? → Standard test
│     └─ Expected frequencies small? → Fisher Exact Test
│
└─ Two categorical variables, paired/repeated measures
   └─ Test for change → McNemar Test
      ├─ Expected frequencies large? → Standard test
      └─ Expected frequencies small? → Fisher Exact variant

COMMON PITFALLS
---------------
- Confusing independence test with McNemar (different research questions)
- Using χ² test when expected frequencies too small
- Violating independence assumption (same person counted multiple times)
- Not reporting effect sizes (only p-values)
- Treating χ² value as effect size (it's not!)
- Using independence test for repeated measures data
- Not checking assumptions before running test
- Over-interpreting significant results with tiny effect sizes
- Confusing observed vs. expected frequencies
- Using continuity correction for large tables (only for df=1)

INTERPRETATION TIPS
-------------------

1. Reporting Results:
   - Descriptive statistics: observed frequencies
   - Test statistic: χ²(df) = value, p = ...
   - Effect size: Cramér's V = ...
   - Interpretation in context

   Example: "A chi-square test of independence revealed a significant
   association between species and choice (χ²(2) = 10.7, p < .01, V = .24).
   Robots were more likely to prefer flowers, while humans preferred data files."

2. Effect Size Interpretation (Cramér's V):
   - Small: V ≈ .10
   - Medium: V ≈ .30
   - Large: V ≈ .50
   - Context-dependent (use as rough guide only)

3. Statistical vs. Practical Significance:
   - Large samples → small effects become significant
   - Always report and interpret effect size
   - Consider practical importance of findings

4. Assumption Checking:
   - Always examine expected frequencies
   - Check independence assumption based on design
   - Use appropriate alternative if violated
   - Report which test variant used (Student/Welch/Fisher/etc.)

ASSUMPTIONS CHECKLIST
---------------------

For All Chi-Square Tests:
☐ Expected frequencies ≥ 5 (or 80% of cells ≥ 5, none < 1)
☐ Observations are independent
☐ Categories are mutually exclusive
☐ Each observation counted in exactly one cell
☐ Random sampling or randomization used

For Test of Independence Specifically:
☐ Both variables are categorical
☐ All participants provide data for both variables

For McNemar Test Specifically:
☐ Same participants measured twice (paired design)
☐ Binary or categorical outcomes
☐ Interested in change/difference, not association

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
-----------------------
- Clinical trials: Response rates (improved/same/worse)
- Education: Comparing pass/fail rates across methods
- Psychology: Testing preference patterns
- Marketing: Customer choice behavior
- Survey research: Association between demographic and opinion variables
- Quality control: Defect rates across production lines
- Medicine: Disease prevalence across groups
- Political science: Voting behavior by demographic
- Before-after studies: Did intervention change outcomes? (McNemar)

COMPARISON OF CHI-SQUARE TESTS
-------------------------------

| Test | Use When | Null Hypothesis | jamovi Location |
|------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Goodness-of-Fit | One variable, known expected distribution | Observed matches expected | One Sample Proportion Tests |
| Independence | Two variables, independent groups | No association between variables | Independent Samples |
| McNemar | Two variables, paired data | No change in proportions | Paired Samples |
| Fisher Exact | Small expected frequencies | Same as Independence/McNemar | Checkbox option |

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TESTS
----------------------------
- χ² test → Z-test (for proportions)
- χ² test → ANOVA (both compare groups, different scales)
- McNemar → Paired t-test (categorical vs. continuous)
- Fisher exact → χ² test (exact vs. approximate)
- Independence → Correlation (categorical vs. continuous variables)

CONTINUITY CORRECTION NOTES
----------------------------
- Only for df = 1 (2×2 tables or 2-category GOF)
- Makes test more conservative (larger p-values)
- Corrects for discrete distribution approximated by continuous
- Historical rule of thumb, not universally required
- Optional in jamovi (checkbox)
- Decision: use for small samples with df=1, skip otherwise

KEY DISTINCTIONS
----------------

Chi-Square vs. McNemar:
- χ² Independence: Are variables related?
- McNemar: Did proportions change?
- Different research questions!
- Same data can yield both tests with different interpretations

Effect Size Reporting:
- Always report Cramér's V (not just χ²)
- χ² increases with sample size (not pure effect measure)
- V is standardized and comparable across studies
- Essential for meta-analysis and comparing studies

Statistical Notation:
- χ²(df) in report = both distribution and test statistic value
- Common convention: χ²(3) = 8.44, p < .05
- Technically conflates distribution with observed value
- Universally accepted notation despite ambiguity
